This project was developed as part of my DATA ANALYST OpenClassrooms course.

This dashboard is an overview of women's participation in the Olympics from 1986 to 2020.
The dataset (free access) has been downloaded from the Kaggle website: Olympics legacy: 1896 - 2020. 

The dataset consists of two csv files :

all_athlete_games (Primary/Main file): Register of Olympics Saga/History
    31 years of Summer Olympics data (1896-2020 span)
    22 years of Winter Olympics data (1924-2020 span)
all_regions (Secondary file)

The data was imported and cleaned in a Python Google Colab notebook then processed on Tableau public.
